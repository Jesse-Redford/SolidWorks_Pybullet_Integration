# Deep_Robot_Development
A full stack development guide for building custom robot assemblies in Solidworks, importing them to pybullet environment, and applying deep learning in a simulator. To get started I recommend following the setup guide and installation instructions located in the Test_Files folder. I included a few videos below as an example of what is included. 



#### Example of exporting URDF file from solidworks assembly, how I created (Assem_test8 folder)
